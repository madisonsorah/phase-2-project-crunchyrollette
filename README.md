# phase-2-project-crunchyrollette
CrunchyRollette is a mock web feature for the anime streaming platform Crunchyroll that enables users to fill out a multiple choice BuzzFeed-style quiz. Based on the userâ€™s responses to each question, the quiz generates a random anime recommendation with a link back to Crunchyroll where the user can directly watch episodes.
